## Trading Strategies
The bot uses various trading strategies to identify arbitrage opportunities. Here are a few strategies you can implement:

You can customize the bot to implement your own strategies. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
def simple_arbitrage(exchange_a, exchange_b, amount):
    price_a = exchange_a.get_price()
    price_b = exchange_b.get_price()

    if price_a < price_b:
        exchange_a.buy(amount)
        exchange_b.sell(amount)
```
